Scores are calculated by combining all repository metrics, including total number of forks, watchers, and commits along with the total number of public repositories on each city's Github profile. Code for this analysis is available on Github [here](https://github.com/hersh-gupta/cities-open-code).</sup>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","pagetitle":"{{< meta title >}} | {{< meta website.title >}}","description-meta":"{{< meta description >}}","author-meta":"Hersh Gupta","theme":["cosmo","../../custom.scss"],"title-block-banner":true,"comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"hersh-gupta/website"}},"title":"City Government Open Source Efforts, Ranked by Their Github Stats","author":"Hersh Gupta","date":"2021-12-22","categories":["Open Source","Government"],"image":"cover.webp"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
