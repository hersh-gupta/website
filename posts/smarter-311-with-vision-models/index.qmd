Every day, residents of any city submit hundreds of 311 requests for everything from broken sidewalks to illegal parking. These systems are important in responding to a city's service requests.

The process seems simple: a resident reports an issue, and the appropriate department responds. But behind the scenes, 311 employees have to constantly recategorize misclassified requests and merge duplicate reports about the same problem.

A pothole might be reported as "street damage" by one resident and "road hazard" by another, requiring manual intervention to connect these related cases.

Artificial intelligence—specifically large multimodal models (LMMs)—could transform 311 operations.

**Why use AI?**

It’s not just about technological efficiency—it's about creating tangible improvements in city services. When a broken traffic signal is reported, accurate categorization means faster response times. When multiple residents report the same fallen tree, automatic merging ensures resources aren't split across duplicate tickets.

Implementing LMMs in 311 systems would be like your phone’s autocorrect, but for service requests. As users are submitting requests, it would:

-   Suggest the correct department classification

-   Verify the issues via the images that are submitted

-   Flag emergency situations for immediate attention

-   Identify and link related requests in the system

Ideally, users would be able to verify the suggestions before submitting their requests, so there’s less danger of [AI slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop) ending up in 311 systems.

**Ok, so how would this work?**

A big problem with integrating AI systems is getting consistent outputs. That’s why the folks at [StanfordNLP](https://github.com/stanfordnlp) have built [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) – a framework for writing programs for language model workflows.

Using DSPy, we can create a reliable pipeline for processing 311 requests that takes the request description text and images, and generated an updated request:

```{python}

original_request: list -> updated_request: list
```

I've created an example implementation that demonstrates these concepts, available in the [Smart 311 System repository](https://github.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311). The repository includes both a simple standalone example and a more complete implementation showing how to structure a production-ready system.

Here's how it works in practice. First, we configure the LMM -- here, I'm using a local instance of LLaVA, an open-source model that can understand both text and images:

```{python}
import dspy
from typing import Literal

# Configure our local LLaVA model
lm = dspy.LM("ollama/llava:7b", api_base="http://127.0.0.1:11434/", api_key="")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

Next, we define all possible service categories. This ensures our system can only assign requests to real departments:

```{python}
ServiceNameLiteral = Literal[
    "Outdoor Dining", "Streetlights", "Litter",
    "Broken Park Equipment", "Damaged Sign",
    # ... and so on for all services
]

```

The heart of the system is its understanding of how to process requests. We provide clear instructions through a system prompt:

```{python}
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a municipal services assistant. Analyze the request
description and image to create a detailed description for city workers.
GUIDELINES:
- Use professional, factual language
- Include details from both text and images
- Remove subjective or emotional language
- Focus on observable facts and specific details
- Include measurements or quantities when visible
- Note any accessibility or safety impacts
"""
```

Now for the clever part. We create a [Signature](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/signatures/?h=signature) that tells DSPy exactly what we expect as input and output:

```{python}
class EnhancerSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Improve the description based on the original description and image."""
    image = dspy.InputField(desc="The image showing the issue")
    original_description = dspy.InputField(desc="The original description text")
    enhanced_description = dspy.OutputField(desc="Enhanced actionable description")
    recommended_service_category = dspy.OutputField(desc="Recommended service category")
```

Finally, we can process actual 311 requests. Here's how it works in practice:

```{python}
# Initialize our predictor
predictor = dspy.Predict(EnhancerSignature)
# Process a new request
image = dspy.Image.from_url("path_to_image.jpg")
description = "Garbage on sidewalk"
result = predictor(
    image=image,
    original_description=description
)
```

When a resident submits a request about garbage on the sidewalk and includes a photo, our system:

1.  Analyzes both the text description and the image
2.  Creates a detailed, professional description for city workers
3.  Automatically selects the correct service category
4.  Returns all this information in a structured format

The full implementation, along with example code and detailed documentation, is available in the [Smart 311 System repository](https://github.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311). The repository includes both a simple example for understanding the core concepts and a more complete implementation showing how to structure a production-ready system.

What’s great about DSPy is its flexibility and consistency. It’s able to handle complex prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning behind the scenes, letting us build a reliable system for 311 users.

**Here’s what to consider**

With any AI-powered technology, cities need to approach them carefully. Public trust is essential and any system that uses AI needs to be accurate and transparent. Here, cities would audit it for bias and performance reviews should be part of any implementation plan.

Also, while compute costs continue to drop, cities should weigh the benefits of implementing something like this against waiting for vendors to integrate these features into standard 311 offerings.

The goal, of course, isn’t to replace human judgment but to augment it, allowing 311 staff to focus on what matters most, responding the requests from residents.

By weighting the tradeoffs of AI thoughtfully, cities can build systems that are more efficient and responsive to community needs.
